This is a Trip Planner Project. The idea behind this is that when going on a big trip
you can use this application to brreak it down. So each country has its own set budget and
you have your own big bugdet for the entire trip.
I used Marshmallow for data validation and serialization 
Also used Tailwind for CSS- Tailwind may have caused some inconsistencies in the design 

Struggled with the jinja but created a base html and had other files extend that

What I learned: Tailwind and Marshmallow, How to deploy a site
